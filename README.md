# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by following the industry standard guidelines put in place. Furthermore, following the requirements set down by the client also ensures that the software functions as intended. Security-wise, making sure to evaluate my code for errors and potential exploits is another way to secure my files. On top of that, implementing encryption algorithms and libraries can also secure my code.
  
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  In order to incorporate user needs into a program, I would meet with the client in order to create a detailed plan. Once I have an outline of what the client wants, I will make sure to review it in order to fully understand the expectations. If needed, I would have additional meetings with the client. In terms of developing the software, I would write it piece by piece making sure to stop and evaluate each part in order to ensure that it is following the expectations. Finally, software automation and testing checks that the software will perform as intended.
  
# How do I approach designing software?
  To design software, there are a few things to follow. First, the project needs to be planned, with the requirements clearly laid out. Next, the software needs to be designed according to those requirements. Then, the software needs to be tested to ensure that errors do not occur. Finally, the software is deployed and maintained. All of this follows the software development life-cycle.
